# dice-roller
Build a custom list of items, then roll dice to select an item randomly.

## Why?
For fun! This is just a fun personal project, put together to experiment with (vanilla) JavaScript during a bootcamp I'm in.

The idea actually came from playing custom lobbies in Hearthstone Battlegrounds with some Twitch.tv streamers. Usually there's some sort of back-and-forth with chat, and ocassionally it takes some time for people to settle on a particular ruleset. I thought it would be fun to have a "gamer-style randomizer" (hence the dice) that would accept custom lists and "roll dice" based on the number of items in the list. 

Obviously, this is designed to be more of a "guide" than anything "formal".

The list is saved to local storage so you won't lose it if you refresh, though the dice rolls will reset.

I'll be updating the styling later ...

### TO DO
* Animated dice!
* Option to select how many dice to roll *e.g. roll 3 dice of whatever values necessary for the list). Or at least a "starter" die (e.g. for 20 dice, start with a d8 then handle the remainder [12] with whatever other dice are necessary; in this case, just a d12 will work).
